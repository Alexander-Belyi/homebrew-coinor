# Homebrew-CoinOR

A [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) repository for [Coin-OR](http://www.coin-or.org) projects. FYI, Cbc and all its dependencies are now in homebrew core, so that could be better way to install Cbc going forward, as it will probably be better maintained.

## How do I install these formulae?

Just

    brew install <formula>
